# My-running-Guru

Web app for calculating running fitness plans. The user is invited to enter a distance for which they are training a desired time, the total number of days they are willing to spend on training per week and the total number of weeks that they have. The app then gives the user a fitness plan, telling them how far to run, and what excercises to do on that day etc.

The backend is written in php, and the front end does some very light preprocessing in js/jquery.

This was mostly made as a learning excercise to learn php.
